# Issue #42: Warehouse Stock Tracker: Apply the reorder threshold rule at its exact boundary

**Difficulty:** Hard  
**Scenario:** Warehouse Stock Tracker: Apply the reorder threshold rule at its exact boundary. The supplied example uses fixed values so the participant can focus on the behaviour of this one operation.  
**Topic:** logical errors, conditions, loops, arrays, strings, classes/objects, constructors, and methods  
**Starter file:** `src/main/java/hackathon/Issue42_WarehouseGoodsThreshold.java`

## Scenario brief
Warehouse Stock Tracker: Apply the reorder threshold rule at its exact boundary. The supplied example uses fixed values so the participant can focus on the behaviour of this one operation.. This is a small, isolated exercise; keep the solution within beginner Java and do not add collections or external libraries.

## Task
In the warehouse stock tracker, the rule activates when the value is at least 100. The current check does not apply the rule when the supplied value is exactly 100. Update the behaviour so the boundary is handled correctly.

## Expected output
The program should produce exactly:

```text
Rule applied
```

## Done when
- [ ] The program produces the expected output.
- [ ] The supplied scenario and test values are preserved.
- [ ] You test one additional sensible boundary case.
- [ ] Your pull request explains the behaviour changed and how you tested it.
